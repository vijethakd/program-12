CHALLENGED FACED
• WE FACING WHILE CODING
• WE TRIED TO GET OUTPUT OF DIAGONAL
• WE DIDN’T GET THE OUTPUT OF N STARS INITIALLY AND THEN WE WORKED ON CODING
AND MAKE CHANGES ON CODING
• WE FACED PROBLEM ON UPLOADING ON GITHUB AS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE
ARE USING GITHUB FOR FIRST TIME

HOW WE FACE THE CHALLENGES
• WE SEPARATELY WORKED FOR THIS AND THEN WE WORKED TOGETHER WITH MANY IDEAS
• WE DEVELOP STRONG COLLOBORATION AMONG US
• WE TOOK HELP OF OUR SENIOURS
• WE TRIED MAY CODES FOR APPLYING A DIAGONAL ON EACH SQUARE

WHAT WE LEART FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT
• MAINLY WE LEARNT HOW TO USE GITHUB
• WE LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF CO-ORDINATION AMONG US. TEAM WORKING IS NOT A
EASY JOB
